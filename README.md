# Kaiwa

**kaiwa** is a *toy* layout generator for mock dialogs in Japanese;
intended for learners such as myself.

For me, I see this as something to produce conversational situations
to present to Lang-8 for corrections, while being personally removed
from the discussion.

To use, clone the repo and open the `index.html` in your browser,
or use [my current version on github-pages](https://bibby.github.io/kaiwa).
